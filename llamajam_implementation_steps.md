# Implementation Plan

Main phases:

1. Project Setup and Infrastructure
2. Authentication System
3. Core Data Models and Database
4. Editor UI and State Management
5. Playback System
6. Search and Navigation

### 1. Project Setup and Infrastructure

Current state: We have a basic TanStack Start template. We need to:

1. Set up SQLite with better-sqlite3
2. Configure Shadcn UI components
3. Set up the directory structure according to the technical architecture
4. Add TailwindCSS configuration
5. Configure Zod for type validation

### 2. Authentication System

Implement basic email/password authentication:

1. Create User model and repository
2. Add authentication routes (login/register)
3. Set up password hashing with bcrypt
4. Implement session management
5. Create protected routes

### 3. Core Data Models and Database

Implement the data layer for:

1. Create SQLite schema for all entities:

   - Users
   - Songs
   - Instruments
   - Sheets
   - Bars
   - Notes

2. Create repositories:

   - SongRepository
   - InstrumentRepository

3. Implement business layer use cases:
   - CreateSong
   - UpdateSong

### 4. Editor UI and State Management

1. Create editor components:

   - Sheet display grid
   - Bar component
   - Note placement interface
   - Instrument selector
   - Track display

2. Implement Zustand stores:

   - Editor state (selected notes, current instrument)
   - Playback state
   - UI state (modals, tooltips)

3. Add editor interactions:
   - Note placement
   - Note editing
   - Bar management
   - Copy/paste functionality

### 5. Playback System

1. Implement WebAudio API integration:

   - Audio context management
   - Note scheduling
   - Playback controls

2. Add visual feedback:
   - Playback position indicator
   - Playing note highlights
   - Transport controls

### 6. Search and Navigation

1. Implement song listing and search:

   - Songs grid/list view
   - Search by title/artist
   - Filtering by difficulty

2. Add navigation features:
   - Song detail view
   - Editor route
   - Navigation guards for auth

Would you like me to start implementing any specific phase? I'd recommend starting with Phase 1 (Project Setup) to lay the foundation for the rest of the features.
