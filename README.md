## About
Llama Jam is a personal project inspired by [Songsterr](https://www.songsterr.com/). It brings together my interests in music and web development. The goal is to sharpen my development skills while creating a useful tool for aspiring musicians.

## Features
The core of the app is comprised of 3 main pages:
- Song list
    - allows users to search for songs to playback or edit, using the following pages, respectivelly
- Song player
    - allows users to playback songs and navigate to the song's editor page
- Song editor
    - allows users to edit songs and create new ones to be added to the list
